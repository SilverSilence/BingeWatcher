#BingeWatcher
This plugin is meant for the website 'www.kissanime.ru' and automatically loads the next episode and increases the video player size.

##How to use
On right-click, you should see an option "Title of New Entry". An Input-Box appears where you can type the show's name. It is stored along with the current URL which is seen as the "last unseen episode"; therefore make sure you're on that page when entering a new series.

By clicking the plugin icon, a popup appears, showing a list of the saved titles as links. That's also the place where you can delete your entries. Clicking a link opens the page of your last unseen episode in a new tab.

##Features
Scrolling with the mouse on the video adjusts volume. You can also use 'i' and 'k' for volume up and down respectively. 
'j' toggles video player size and 'l' brings you to the next episode (for when you want to skip the outro or similar).
