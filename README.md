The idea is to automatically load the next episode and increase video size. The version is still very basic and thus could be improved in terms of features and optimization.

##How to use
By right-clicking a selected text, one can store a new show-entry. It is stored along with the current URL which is seen as the "last unseen episode". The next step is to right-click the "next episode button/link". This updates the entry with the DOM-Path to that link.

By clicking the plugin icon, a popup appears, showing a list of the saved titles as links. That's also the place where a user can delete his entries.
